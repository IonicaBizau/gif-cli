> Gif animations in your terminal!

[![gif-cli](doc/nyan.gif)](#)

## Installation


This tool uses `image-to-ascii` as dependency–that means you have to [install GraphicsMagick first](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/image-to-ascii#installation). Then you can install `gif-cli`:

```sh
$ npm i -g gif-cli
```

## CLI Usage

```sh
gif-cli my-animation.gif
# or even shorter
gif my-animation.gif
```


Then your animated gif will appear in your terminal. :tada:


## :clipboard: Example


Here is an example how to use this package as library. To install it locally, as library, you can do that using `npm` (or `yarn`):

```sh
# Using npm
npm install --save gif-cli

# Using yarn
yarn add gif-cli
```



```js
// Dependencies
var GifCli = require("gif-cli")
  , CliFrames = require("cli-frames")
  ;

// Convert the gif file into text frames
GifCli(__dirname + "/nyantocat.gif", function (err, frames) {
    if (err) { return Logger.log(err, "error"); }

    // Show the animation
    var animation = new CliFrames();
    animation.load(frames);
    animation.start({
        repeat: true
      , delay: 50
    });
});
```

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`

Thanks! :heart:


## :dizzy: Where is this library used?
If you are using this library in one of your projects, add it in this list. :sparkles:
